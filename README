This makefile is able to cross compile and create a complete filesystem able to be used inside a embeded linux board.

Instructions:
	Put a tarbal of the linux kernel 2.6.29 in the same folder of this makefile and type 'make'.
	<N> folders named <a,b,c> are created.
	The folders you need to be able to use your board are 'fs' who contains the filesystem and 'kernel' who contains the kernel image named 'uImage'.

Required software:
	quilt
	sed
	wget
	tar
	bzip2
	gzip
	mkimage

Assumes directory named /opt/arm-2009q1/bin/ with toolchain, the kernel must be located in the same place as the makefile.

Targets inside the makefile:

	all: generates the filesystem, contents  and kernel image
	unpack: download and unpack all the required software. If you provide your own packages set the variable DOWNLOAD=false
	createfs: generates the filesystem by creating the necessary directories, getting the libraries from the toolchain and creating the device nodes 
	createscripts: copies the necessary scripts to the created file system
	kernel: applies the patches to the kernel and creates the kernel's image
	install-kernel: copies the kernel image to the kernel folder on the top directory
	busybox: crosscompiles and installs busybox
	lighthttp: crosscompiles and installs lighthttp
	iptools: crosscompiles and installs iptools
	crosscompile: crosscompiles and installs busybox, lighthttp and iptools
	clean-all: remove all the auto generated folders and files
	clean: removes the crosscompile folder
	clean-download: removes the downloaded files
	clean-done: removes the folders were the done job are stored (fs and kernel)
	initfolders: creates the fs (directory in which the filesystem will be built) and crossc (directory to help on the crosscompilation of the apps) directories
